Below are some links to some of the websites I have built.
<br><br>
"Dolydd-Gobaith" which translates to "meadows of hope" from Welsh, is a regenerative agriculture project based in the Tanat valley in Wales. Click on the dolydd-gobaith logo below to visit the site. 
<br><br>
"Fferm Goedwig Gymunedol Dyffryn Tanat Valley Community Forest Farm Community Interest Company was established in September 2020 but the idea of some type of community nature reserve raised its head several years earlier on a Christmas walk in Delamere Forest. When 30 acres of upland sheep pasture came up for sale in Pen-Y-Garnedd, Montgomeryshire in 2019, the idea became a real possibility. The seller of the land was remarkably patient while we raised £120,000 but in February 2021 the land finally changed hands and became a community asset. We held a competition for an appropriate name for the land that was less of a mouthful than the official name. The winning entry was Dolydd Gobaith (Meadows of Hope) which I feel sums up the sentiment behind this project."
